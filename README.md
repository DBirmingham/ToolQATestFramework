# DemoQA E-Commerce Website

A project involving testing an ecommerce site using Behaviour-Driven development (BDD) and Test-Driven Development (TDD). We have
used an agile team methodology to track progress, assign roles and distribute the work evenly.

The automation testing framework was built using Cucumber based on the selenium webdriver with Capybara.

## Sprints 

## Using Capybara

## Using Cucumber
Write feature files using GWT Gherkin syntax. A guide to this can be found here.

Navigate to the root of the project and run the cucumber command. This will read through all of the feature files and print out template step definitions. You can then use the POM to access and manipulate elements on the page.
